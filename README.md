#### Minecraft Server

I'm building a [[Minecraft]] server for my friends and I.
- build in creative
- build in survival
	- build in survival but like EarthMC where it's basically creative without flying
	- build in special environments which encourage special kinds of buildings
		- cold: build light everywhere
		- wet: build roof everywhere for waterproof
		- hot: build roof for shade everywhere
		- certain environments only grow
			- melons
			- crops in the ground
			- trees?????? cocoa pods???
	- build big ciites, allow people to coexist in them
		- encourage development of large cities - see civmc icenia
			- encourage people to have to live in big cities in order to have better tools
			- easy access to high quality food
				- easy to grow dirt
				- harder to grow steak
			- forge tools
			- produce things
			- trade! buy stuff!
	- constraints
		- let people own things
		- remove fear of losing things
			- people love building their kingdoms and hate losing them
				- civmc also mitigates that fear...
	- arenas/dungeions
		- temp grinding places for mining and killing mobs
		- don't die! or you die!
		- mining: have to pack a ton of food and get as deep in the mine as possible to get the best loot
		- killing: survive
- link worlds together with some kind of portal system
	- allow minecarts to travel between worlds
